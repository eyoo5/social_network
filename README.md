## About My Project

I originally wanted to learn about Tailwind, but while researching I was pulled into learning about Next.js as well! Here is a medium article I wrote on one thing I discovered:
[Client Side Routing in Next.js](https://medium.com/@eyoo5/client-side-routing-in-next-js-react-apps-479fdfbf30d3)

# Take a Look

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
